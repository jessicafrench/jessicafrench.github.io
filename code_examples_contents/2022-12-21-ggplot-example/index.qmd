### A basic scatter plot

```{r}
example_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()

example_plot
```

Lets spice this up a bit by having each penguin species show up as a different color and adding a theme.

### Mapping aesthetics

reminder: when changing something on the graph based on a variable, like point color below, it needs to go inside the function `aes()`.

```{r}
example_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_light()

example_plot
```

This is looking good but we can do better. Lets update the axis titles and give our graph a title.

### Axis labels and titles

```{r}
example_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = "Bill Depth (mm)",
       y = "Bill Length (mm)",
       title = "Penguin Bill Depth Compared to Bill Length")

example_plot
```
