# Graphing with ggplot

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### A basic scatter plot

```{r warning = FALSE}

example_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()

example_plot
```

Lets spice this up a bit by having each penguin species show up as a different color and adding a theme. 

### Mapping aesthetics
reminder: when changing something on the graph based on a variable, like point color below, it need to go inside the function `aes()`.

```{r}
example_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_light()

example_plot
```
