    "text": "The rocky intertidal zone has provided a natural laboratory for studying species interactions and environmental extremes 1. During high tide organisms are exposed to crashing waves and debris that can dislodge or crush them while low tide brings the risk of extreme heat and desiccation 1–3. Environmental extremes are combined with limited space, predation, and competition to make for one of the most challenging habitats in the world 1,2,4. The heterogeneity of the environment and complexity of species interactions make it challenging to identify the impact a single factor has on intertidal organisms 5. A great deal of research has been directed at understanding the how temperature, oxygen levels, marine nutrient inputs, oceanographic conditions, and species interactions effect intertidal organisms, that has not been the case for drought 5.\n\n\n\nOne mechanism that could result in drought impacting intertidal organisms independent of sea surface temperature or air temperature is through inputs of terrestrial organic matter (TOM). Small streams that drain directly into the ocean transport TOM in the form of leaf litter that is consumed by grazers in the intertidal 6. Food availability throughout the year can have major impacts on reproductive output, larvae survival, and recruitment 6,7. This is why I hypothesize that drought will negatively impact abundance and diversity in the rocky intertidal zone in the Coast Range Ecoregion in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Map showing the site locations and extent of the Coast Range Ecoregion."

    "text": "I recently started the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management after graduating from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology. I previously studied anthropology at the University of Oregon, graduating in 2013, before serving in the United States Coast Guard from 2015 to 2019. My time in the Coast Guard and time spent working as a deckhand in the commercial fishing industry allowed me to experience multiple perspectives on the regulation of marine resources. An internship with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and volunteering with Oregon Reef Check exposed me to how data is collected and used to monitor the ecological and community impacts of marine reserves. I hope to use the skills I am learning in the MEDS program to aid in the management of marine resources and make the regulatory process transparent and understandable to marine resource users."
