    "text": "I recently started the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management after graduating from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology. I previously studied anthropology at the University of Oregon, graduating in 2013, before serving in the United States Coast Guard from 2015 to 2019. My time in the Coast Guard and time spent working as a deckhand in the commercial fishing industry allowed me to experience multiple perspectives on the regulation of marine resources. An internship with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and volunteering with Oregon Reef Check exposed me to how data is collected and used to monitor the ecological and community impacts of marine reserves. I hope to use the skills I am learning in the MEDS program to aid in the management of marine resources and make the regulatory process transparent and understandable to marine resource users."
